📌 Project Overview
🎯 Key Objectives:
Build a one-page interactive global statistics dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Focus on user experience, responsive design, and basic DOM manipulation

Provide real-world data presentation (static or via APIs)

Deploy the project using GitHub Pages

🎨 UX/UI Design
A clean, intuitive layout displaying global data points in modular, color-coded sections. The dashboard is designed with clarity and accessibility in mind, optimized for desktops and mobile screens.

🛠️ User Stories
As a user, I want to:

✅ View population stats by continent.

✅ See economic indicators per region or country.

✅ View current currency for selected countries.

✅ Display export and import data.

✅ Experience a responsive and visually clear dashboard.

✅ Load the app quickly with minimal interaction needed.

🎨 Colours

Orange	#ffa500	Background
Light Blue	#e6f2ff	Economy section background
Pale Yellow	#fffbe6	Currency section background
Sky Blue	#e6f7ff	Exportation section background
Soft Red	#fff0f0	Importation section background

A warm and vibrant palette to distinguish sections and enhance visual accessibility.

🔠 Fonts
Roboto (from Google Fonts) is used for both headings and body text for readability and professional appearance.

📐 Wireframes
Wireframes are designed for a single-page application showing a header, multiple stat boxes, and a responsive footer.
📌 [Add wireframe screenshots or Figma links here]

The app uses Font Awesome icons and emojis to clearly represent each data section, reducing image load and improving performance.
