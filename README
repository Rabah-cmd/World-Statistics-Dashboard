## 📌 Project Overview
🎯 Key Objectives:
- Build a one-page interactive global statistics dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Focus on user experience, responsive design, and basic DOM manipulation
- Provide real-world data presentation (static or via APIs)
- Deploy the project using GitHub Pages

## 🎨 UX/UI Design
A clean, intuitive layout displaying global data points in modular, color-coded sections. The dashboard is designed with clarity and accessibility in mind, optimized for desktops and mobile screens.

## 🛠️ User Stories
As a user, I want to:

✅ View population stats by continent.

✅ See economic indicators per region or country.

✅ View current currency for selected countries.

✅ Display export and import data.

✅ Experience a responsive and visually clear dashboard.

✅ Load the app quickly with minimal interaction needed.

## 🎨 Colours

| Colour Name | Hex Code | Usage |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| Orange | #ffa500 | Background |
| Light Blue | #e6f2ff | Economy section background |
| Pale Yellow | #fffbe6 | Currency section background |
| Sky Blue | #e6f7ff | Exportation section background |
| Soft Red | #fff0f0 | Importation section background |

A warm and vibrant palette to distinguish sections and enhance visual accessibility.

## 🔠 Fonts
Roboto (from Google Fonts) is used for both headings and body text for readability and professional appearance.

## 📐 Wireframes
Wireframes are designed for a single-page application showing a header, multiple stat boxes, and a responsive footer.
